# Temperature Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes air quality data to identify pollution levels and trends.

## Dataset

- The dataset includes air quality indicators such as **SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, PM10, Wind Speed, Temperature, RH, and Rain**.
- Missing values have been identified and handled.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Git Best Practices

- Ensure `.gitignore` is set up to exclude unnecessary files.
- Use `git rm -r --cached .` if unwanted files were previously committed.
